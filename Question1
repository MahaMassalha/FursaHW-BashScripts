Question 1: Write a bash script that collects two numbers from the user and then prints a message if these two numbers are smaller or greater than 100.

     #! /usr/bin/bash
     echo "please enter first number: "
     read  num1
     echo "please enter second number: "
     read  num2
     sum=$((num1 + num2))
     if [ $sum -lt 100 ]
     then
            echo "Sum is Less than 100"
     elif [ $sum -gt 100 ]
     then
            echo "Sum is more than 100"
     else
            echo "Sum Equals 100"
     fi
